## by (Eman Abdelhalim)


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area and the data consistwd of 16 features and attributes of approximately 183412 rides, the attributes included duration second of rides and time that trips started and ended in it aslo stations name ,user and gender types. 8265 data points were removed from the analysis due to inconsistencies or missing information.


## Summary of Findings

> 1- I found duration second has a long tailed distribution with low trips with high duration second when plotted the duration second on log scale the distribution looks unimodel with one peak on 400 and 700 that mean average duration of most trips is about 400 to 700 second approximately 8 to 11 minutes.
2- I figured out the Top station with most starts is : Market St at 10th St (3649 times of start)
and the Top station with most ends is :San Francisco Caltrain Station 2 (4624 times of ends ).
3- Most popular trips by number of trips is:Berry St at 4th St & San Francisco Ferry Building (327 trips.
4-Most members gender is Males (130500 member)
5-Most popular user type is Subscribers (158386 user)
6-the most popular bike by number of times used : bike 4797(179 times)
7-the most popular times of the day trips starts and ends in are : 5 PM, 8AM, 6PM, 9AM, 4PM
so most customers and subscribers prefer to use bikes in the earlier times of morning and afternoon times.
8-most popular trips take place in 28-02-2019 and 21-02-2019 and 19-02-2019 Which falls on Thursdays or every week that mean most trips taken in thursdays
9-Most popular trips by seconed used is : Fell St at Stanyan St & Fell St at Stanyan St (390598 seconds used)
10-Most popular bike by number of seconds used is : Bike 5481 (214351 seconds used)
11-the customers using bikes longer than the subscribers despite of number of customer users less than subscriber users 
12- using multivariate exploration I found females customers using bikes longer than male custmers and aslo females subscribers using bikes longer than male subscribers which is mean females used bikes more than males


## Key Insights for Presentation

> 1-duration (second) in dataset taken a large range of values, from about 60 sec to 21,000 sec at the highest. plotted on a log scale, and the distribution takes a unimodel shape.
2-Most popular trips by number of trips is:Berry St at 4th St & San Francisco Ferry Building (327 trips)
3-most popular times of the day trips starts in are : 5 PM, 8AM, 6PM, 9AM, 4PM. so most customers and subscribers prefer to use bikes in the earlier times of morning and afternoon times.
4-Most popular trips based on seconed used is : Fell St at Stanyan St & Fell St at Stanyan St (390598 seconds used)
5- it looks the customers using bikes longer than the subscribers despite of number of customer users less than subscriber users.
6- females customers using bikes longer than male custmers and aslo females subscribers using bikes longer than male subscribers which is mean females used bikes more than males
